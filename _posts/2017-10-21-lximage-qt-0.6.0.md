The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of lximage-qt 0.6.0

We had a lot of improvements under the hood, for example, the usage of const iterators and other changes that have made lximage-qt faster and more robust. The most visible changes are regression fixes in the thumbnail view, the usage of HighDpiPixmaps for 4K screens and the new ability to capture screen areas. Also noteworthy is the new experimental upload feature, right now for imgur and imageshack.

The complete list of changes is available in our CHANGELOG file.

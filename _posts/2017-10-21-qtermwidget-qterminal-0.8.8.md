The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of qtermwidget and qterminal, both in version 0.8.0.

We had a lot of improvements under the hood, mainly the usage of const iterators and other changes that will make qterminal faster and robust. Furher more we fixed some memory leaks and overhaul memory management in the widget. Visible changes are the usage of HighDpiPixmaps for 4K screens, improved UTF8 functionality, improved terminal and subterminal handling, emulation fixes, action, cursor, filter, font, settings and escape sequence handling. We introduced also a few new features like human readable font settings, custom QSS styles, better paste functionality (trim, confirm multiline pastes) and directional navigation within terminals.

The complete list of changes is available in our CHANGELOG file.
